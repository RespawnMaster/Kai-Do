KaiDo V1.1

-added pages (switchable via arrow keys once next page is populated with tasks)

-Removed changes to order of tasks when crossed out or uncrossed out

-Settings Button added that allows to change amount of tasks displayed per page. (Default 6 due to this being the best fit on my device)

If there are any features you would like let me know and I'll try my best : )
